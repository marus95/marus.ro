A simple portfolio responsive made with css html and js/scripts.

Issues: Due to the fact that the mobile browser has a built-in search bar, the menu bar automatically changes position according to it, causing a small gap between the menu and the next page. For instance, facebook preview does not have this search bar and the menu's bug automatically disappears.
Fix: soon - need to make the mobile version without media query.
