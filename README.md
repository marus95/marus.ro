A simple portfolio responsive made with css html and js/scripts.

Knowing issues: On mobile browser the menu bar changes it's position when the navbar/searchbar of the browser it's not hidden.
Example: when the website it is opened via facebook preview the menu bar dosn't changes it's original position (facebook preview dosn't have a searchbar).
Fix: soon - need to make the mobile version without media query.
